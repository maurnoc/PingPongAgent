# PingPongAgent
## Build Instructions 
make all 
## Running
sh ./AgentSystem.sh PingAgent <br />													
Check path in .sh file to ensure it is accurate for the location of running.  
## Issues
When placed on seperate machines, IP's of the other machines need to be hard coded.<br /> 
Check AgentController for locations.<br />
This only currently works for PingAgent and PongAgent.
