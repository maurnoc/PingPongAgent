# PingPongAgent
## Build Instructions 
make all 
## Running
sh ./AgentSystem.sh PingAgent 
Check path in .sh file to ensure it is accurate for the location of running.  
## Issues
When placed on seperate machines, IP's of the other machines need to be hard coded. 
This only currently works for PingAgent and PongAgent.
